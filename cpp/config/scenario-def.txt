Reallocation vs No-Reallocation

File Name: scenario_1.json

Cross Pattern - Clear Benefit

Four agents start in corners of a 4×4m square and need to swap diagonally.

File Name: scenario_2.json

Dense Cross Pattern - Moderate Conflict

This increases agent density and makes collision avoidance more challenging

File Name: scenario_3.json

Circle Formation - High Conflict

Four agents arranged in a circle need to rotate to positions 90 degrees clockwise. This creates maximum path crossing - every agent's path intersects with every other agent's path


BVC vs On-Demand

File Name: scenario_4.json

Cross Pattern with BVC

Same as Scenario 1 but explicitly forcing BVC collision avoidance. BVC is conservative - it allocates exclusive space to each agent. This means agents take wider paths to avoid each other.


File Name: scenario_5.json

Cross Pattern with On-Demand

Same spatial configuration but with on-demand collision avoidance. On-demand only avoids when necessary, allowing tighter coordination.


'''
By comparing scenarios 4 and 5, you can claim: "Reallocation provided X% improvement with BVC but only Y% with on-demand, suggesting that conservative collision methods benefit more from optimized task assignment
'''


File Name: scenario_6.json

Dense Pattern - Collision Method Comparison

Higher density version (6 agents in 4×4m space) to really stress-test the interaction between collision method and reallocation.


Moving Targets

File Name: scenario_7.json

Translating Goals

Goals move in straight lines at constant velocity. Agents must track moving targets while avoiding each other.


File Name: scenario_8.json

Circular Goals

Goals orbit in circles around fixed centers. More complex motion pattern than straight lines.

File Name: scenario_9.json

Combined Motion Goals

Goals both translate AND rotate

PARAMETER SENSITIVITY (10-12): Tuning Analysis
Scenario 10: "Reallocation Period Sweep"
Fixed scenario, varying reallocation_period: 0.5s, 1.0s, 2.0s, 4.0s, never (static)
Why this matters: Helps readers understand the trade-off between reallocation frequency and performance. Too frequent = computational overhead. Too rare = missed opportunities.
Scenario 11: "Prediction Horizon Sweep"
Fixed scenario, varying _prediction_horizon: 0.5s, 1.0s, 2.0s, 3.0s
Why this matters: Shows how far ahead you need to predict for effective reallocation. Too short = not better than reactive. Too long = predictions become inaccurate.
Scenario 12: "Combined Parameter Analysis"
Tests interaction between prediction horizon and reallocation period. This is your "heat map" scenario - you can create a 2D plot showing optimal parameter combinations.
